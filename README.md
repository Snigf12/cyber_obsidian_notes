# Obsidian Notes

This are my Cybersecurity Obsidian Notes.

There are other IT topics but you'll find good snippets and scripts to use.
This is like a Cheat Sheet project, if you want to search for any topic, you will get the steps and explanation to do it.
It will be growing.

To see the notes, just copy and paste the folder Cyber_Obsidian_Notes to your obsidian vault.
