> [!tip] You can add tips that look nice with this:
> And you can add a description or not
>> [!tip] and add a sub-tip too

Add an info box
> [!info] You can add info
> With more info


Add a note box:
> [!note] Is this a note?
> Yes it is!

Add a faq:
> [!faq] This is a faq
> yupi

You can add it with hiding option using (-) or (+) if you want it to be hidden or visible:
> [!faq]- This is a faq
> yupi

We can do that with questions too:
> [!question]+ This time I used + instead of -?
> Yes, this is the answer to the question.

You can create tables using | and  | -- | to separate headers from content. In the end Obsidian helps and you won't see I used the characters, and it let you add rows or columns:

```
| This is a header1 | This is a header2 |
| -- | -- |
| Content1 | Content2|
```

Result:

| This is a header1 | This is a header2 |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Content1          | Content2          |
